Tools used; <br>
  • Python <br>
  • Apache Spam Assassian Dataset<br>
  • skLearn Machine learning library
  • Anaconda enviroment 

# Detection process. 
• Load CSV file into a data frame <br>
• Preprocess data - i.e remove headers, turn text into lowercase, remove Special Characters <br>
• use the Term Frequency and the Naives Bayes library <br>
• Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) of datasets.<br>
• Then evaulate performance and test on actual spam emails to test accuracy.
